# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-Implementation
This project demonstrates how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) works internally by implementing it from scratch using NumPy instead of using any machine learning library like sklearn.
We:

Start with a 2D dataset

Center the data
Compute the covariance matrix
Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Select the principal component
Project 2D data into 1
Visualize original vs reduced dat
This helps in understanding how dimensionality reduction actually works mathematically.

🧠 What is PCA?

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to:
Reduce number of dimensions
Keep maximum information (variance)
Remove redundancy
Speed up ML models
Visualize high-dimensional data


Output

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

1D projected data

A plot showing:
